#You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers. This new list should contain every number in the list numbers but each number should be squared.
#numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]

#squared_numbers = [number * number for number in numbers]
#print(squared_numbers)


## 2)finding even numbers

#numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
#even_number = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
#print(even_number)

# 3) data overlap
#file_1 = [1, 2, 3]
#file_2 = [2, 3, 4]
#result = [int(num) for num in file_1 if num in file_2]
#print(result)
